			<p>
				For the longest time at the JSE I have worked in a data intensive role within a team responsible for providing a reporting solution to internal and external clients. Some of the larger projects for which I was responsible included orders data and top of book market statistics reporting and research, the equity market billing methodology change to a value based pricing model and the bond market billing methodology change and implementation of an interim invoicing solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				The orders data and top of book market data project involved providing a reporting solution for the orders data within the equity market. The challenge in this space is the volume of data (At the time the JSE would process about 8 to 10 million records daily). The solution provided reporting on a variety of metrics including the spreads per instrument. In addition to providing the reporting solution I was responsible for conducting research and analysis on the data. Some of this research included the effects of the implementation of collocation in the equity market and it's impact on spreads and order sizes as well as per second order rates.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the cash equities and bond pricing projects my role included creating a solution which could model different billing methodologies. The model output could then be analysed and compared to clients actual spend in various dimensions including trade type, trader and member firm client. During the equities methodology change the JSE followed a co-creation approach with clients. This involved coming to consensus and narrowing down the proposed methodologies with market participants and then running various scenarios. These scenarios were anonymised and presented at a high level with the forum and then again presented to each member firm on an individual basis. Given this approach the JSE was able to successfully change the methodology and prepare clients for the change so that they could adjust their behaviour to minimize the impact of the change. This methodology change paved the way for new types of business which provided the JSE with record returns in the coming years. The challenges faced in this project were the volume of data, the exchanged processed approx. 500k - 800k billable events per day, as well as creating a solution which could run scenarios in a configurable way so that no code changes would be necessary to create new billing models.
			</p>
			<p>
				After successfully changing the methodologies for the equity market trading and clearing &amp; settlement billing streams the same modeling system was enhanced to assist with the change of the spot bond market billing methodology. The volumes of data were not a challenge this time, the bond market only processed about 80k transactions per day, the challenges were more around finding a balance between the needs of business and the overall JSE pricing philosophy. After successfully finding the appropriate balance I was asked to generate the data required for the invoicing system from the modeling solution.
