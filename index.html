			Currently I am working part time in a commercial finance team helping them out by automating their monthly reporting tasks. I have a degree in Economics and Econometrics and an honours degree in Investment Management but I have always been more interested in computers. My first real dive into programming was at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. I joined a small team of developers whose job it was to maintain and progress an in house reporting system. Here we used T SQL and VBA to do all kinds of things ranging from data mining to ETLs.

			I had found my calling and wanted to learn more. So I looked into a few courses on object oriented programming. I picked one which taught Python through making games. I had just stumbled on my new favorite programming language. Since then I have used python for scripting, web development, web scraping and data munging and given that Python has become one of the defacto languages for data science it has been a perfect fit in my career at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange where data is plentiful. More recently I have begun learning client side web development through TypeScript and Google's angular framework and I am really enjoying it.

			In the time away from my finance job I am working on creating a software development business. The initial product is a data reporting and visualization tool which will encompass all that I have learned while working on these types of projects throughout my career.
		</p>

		<h3>How I keep my skills sharp</h3>
		<p>
			To keep my skills sharp I read, listen to podcasts, attend meetups (GPUG, PyData, GDG etc) and work on my own projects. As mentioned above I am in the process of building a data reporting and visualization tool. The tool is powered by the django rest framework, celery, redis and Google's angular 4 framework as well as an in house built data abstraction library called overlay which I plan to open source in the future.

			Here's a rough demo I plan to include in the documentation of overlay overlay-demo.
		</p>

		<h3>My Interests</h3>

		<p>
			What I want to do next

			Next I would like to focus on the following:

			Front end web development through Google's angular 4 framework
			Front end data visualizations with D3
			Data science, machine learning and data visualization with the Python data analysis stack (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Learn etc)
			As I mentioned I plan to create my own business and my dream is to work on it full time. However until I can afford to I am happy to live my dual life ;)
